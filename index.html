           <h2>I prefer buying in-season <strong>fruits and vegetables</strong> because they are fresher, tastier, cheaper, and have higher nutritional content. North America has plenty of tasty, seasonal fruits and vegetables that keep my kitchen cooking exciting.</h2><br><br>
           <p>Seasonal fruits and vegetables are produced and consumed around a particular time of the year. For example, I can usually buy Medjool dates during Spring and find them shortly after farmers have harvested them.</p><br><br>
